# ms-tvseries-and-characters
 
This is a simple project for learning purposes. The idea is to build two applications (TV Shows API and Characters API) using a microservices architecture. These APIs register TV Shows and their Characters separately but communicate with each other through Messaging Services keeping both applications up to date.
I wanna explore some concepts with this project like Clean Architecture, some patterns like CQRS, Mediator, and some others, write tests, build a Database for each application, use Docker, a Messaging Service like Kafka, and a few other things that would be nice to explore. 
This README will be better detailed as the project advances so I could explain all the concepts around it. Feel free to keep track of incoming commits to see the application progress.
